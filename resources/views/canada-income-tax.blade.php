                        Income taxes in Canada comprise the bulk of the annual revenues of the Government of Canada, as well
                        as the administrations of the Provinces of Canada. Tax collection arrangements facilitate diverse
                        administrations to impose taxes through a sole supervision and collection bureau. The federal
                        government accumulates personal income taxes on behalf of the entire provinces as well as
                        territories except for Quebec. It also collects corporate income taxes on behalf of the entire
                        provinces and territories excluding Quebec, Alberta, and Ontario. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA)
                        administers Canada's federal income tax system. However, Quebec's income tax system is managed by
                        Revenu Québec, that was previously known as Ministère du Revenu du Québec.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fs-16">
                        Both personal and corporate Canadian federal income taxes are imposed under the specifications of
                        the Income Tax Act. It is to be noted that provincial as well as territorial income taxes are
                        charged under a range of provincial acts.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fs-16">
                        The Canadian income tax structure is more of a self-assessment establishment, wherein the taxpayers
                        evaluate their tax charge by filing a return with the CRA by the mandatory filing time limit. CRA
                        would then review the return established on the return filed and on the data obtained from employers
                        as well as financial corporations, amending it for noticeable inaccuracies. An appeal for an
                        assessment can be made by a taxpayer who disagrees with CRA's assessment of a particular return.
                    </p>
